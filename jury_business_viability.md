### 1. Who will pay for this system—the government, bus operators, or commuters?
- **Primary:** State transport authorities or private bus operators (as a service/technology upgrade).
- **Secondary:** Government grants (Smart City Mission, urban mobility funds).
- **Commuters:** Core features are free; premium features (e.g., advanced alerts) could be paid, but not required for basic use.

### 2. How will you generate sustainable revenue while keeping it free/cheap for users?
- **B2B SaaS Model:** Charge authorities/operators a subscription or per-bus fee for the platform, analytics, and admin tools.
- **Premium Services:** Optional paid features for commuters (e.g., premium notifications, travel insurance, loyalty rewards).
- **Data Insights:** Offer anonymized analytics to city planners or mobility partners (with privacy compliance).
- **Advertising:** Local business ads or offers in the app (optional, non-intrusive).
