# Strategies for Solving Slow Internet Problems in Small Cities

1. **Offline Caching**
   - App/browser saves last known bus locations, routes, and timetables locally (IndexedDB/localStorage).
   - Users see cached data when offline or on slow internet.

2. **Lightweight APIs & Data**
   - Backend sends only essential, small-sized data (no heavy images).
   - Data is compressed and paginated where possible.

3. **SMS-Based Access**
   - Users can get bus info and ETA via SMS, which works on basic phones and without internet.

4. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Frontend is PWA-ready, so it works offline and loads instantly after the first visit.

5. **Graceful Fallback UI**
   - App detects slow/no internet and shows cached data with a clear message.
   - Disables features that need live data when offline.

6. **Sync When Online**
   - App automatically fetches fresh data and updates the cache as soon as the connection is restored.

7. **Minimalist Design**
   - UI avoids heavy graphics and animations for fast load times even on 2G/3G.

These strategies ensure users in small cities always have access to essential transit information, even with slow or unreliable internet.
