# Jury Q&A: Problem Understanding

---

### 1. Why do you think small cities need this more than metros where apps already exist?

- **Digital Divide:** Most existing transit apps are designed for metros, assuming users have smartphones, stable internet, and digital literacy. In small cities, many commuters still use feature phones or have patchy connectivity.
- **Lack of Reliable Info:** Bus schedules in small cities are often unreliable, with little to no real-time information available to the public.
- **Inclusivity:** Small cities have a higher proportion of elderly, non-English speakers, and digitally less literate users who are left out by mainstream solutions.
- **Local Needs:** Small cities face unique challenges—like sudden route changes, fewer buses, and less IT infrastructure—that require lightweight, accessible, and offline-capable solutions.

### 2. How is your solution different from existing ones like Chalo, Moovit, or Google Maps?

- **Offline & Low-Bandwidth Support:** Caches last known bus locations/routes for offline use—mainstream apps require constant internet.
- **SMS-Based Bus Info:** Users can get live bus info and ETA via SMS, no smartphone or app needed. Mainstream apps do not offer this.
- **Lost and Found System:** Built-in lost & found reporting and management for commuters and admins.
- **Safety-First Features:** SOS button, incident reporting, and admin/authority notifications for emergencies.
- **Inclusive, Multilingual, and Simple UI:** English and Hindi support, easy to add more languages, and designed for all ages and digital literacy levels.
- **Open Data & Modular APIs:** Public endpoints for bus locations, routes, and timetables for easy integration.
- **Tier-2/Tier-3 City Focus:** Lightweight, cloud-optimized, and tailored for basic devices and low digital literacy.
- **Community & Rewards:** Features for feedback, rewards, and community engagement.

### 3. What key pain point of commuters does this solve first?

- **Lack of reliable, real-time bus information for all commuters—including those without smartphones or stable internet.**
- Commuters can know where their bus is, when it will arrive, and get updates even if they have a basic phone (via SMS) or are offline (via cached data).
- This reduces uncertainty, waiting time, and anxiety at bus stops—especially in Tier-2/Tier-3 cities where digital access is limited and bus schedules are often unreliable.
